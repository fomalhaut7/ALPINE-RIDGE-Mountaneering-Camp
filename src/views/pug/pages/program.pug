                    p We have a history of traveling out through Alps, Caucasus, Ands and Himalayans. Many guides now also live all year round in the European Alps but we maintain the flexibility to move around, finding the route that's right for our clients.

                    p The Mountaineers offers courses, clinics, and seminars year round. Whether you’re looking for an introductory seminar or an intensive course, our instructional programs can help you get outside. With seven branches in western Washington, we’ll teach you outdoor skills close to enjoy the PNW and beyond.
                    br
                    p Plan ahead using our course calendar. It take a few months for planning, scheduling, conditioning, and registration. Enrollment usually opens two or three months before your first session. Many of our course are taught in the season before you'd typically participate in the activity. For example, we teach sea kayaking in the spring so you'll be ready to paddle in the summer.
