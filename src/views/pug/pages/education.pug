                        p In 2018, we are introducing the new Alpine Skills Development Program aimed at skilled climbers who have given a substantial amount of their time to help new climbers through The Mountaineers, and who want to take their own climbing skills to the next level. Through a series of structured, educational field trips with support from peers, volunteers, and professional guides, the Alpine Skills Development Program will help you develop your skills to benefit our greater community. The Progressive Climbing Education (PCE) initiative is an organization-wide, multi-faceted approach to developing leaders, enhancing skills for our volunteers, growing curriculum, conserving climbing areas, and fostering the highest quality climbing programs.

                        p In the coming year, we will offer two paths of customized skill building within the Alpine Skills Development Program: one for rock climbing and one for ice climbing. Each program will offer a combination of challenging climbs with guides and instructional climbs with volunteers to get you outside, pushing your grades and skills to the next level. We will also have trips to give you opportunities to lead and spend time in groups with your peers. The education will be rounded out with a combination of evening sessions, classes, and slideshows to help hone your skills. This will be an intensive, but highly educational, experience. Right now we're launching the Ice Climbing Program, with more information to come on the Rock Climbing Program.

                        p If you are a highly dedicated Mountaineers climbing volunteer and would benefit from  opportunities to expand your skills and increase your comfort zone in steep ice terrain, this opportunity may be for you. We will pair you with more experienced climbers who can "show you the ropes" of technical ice climbing and give you opportunities to lead climb with peers.
