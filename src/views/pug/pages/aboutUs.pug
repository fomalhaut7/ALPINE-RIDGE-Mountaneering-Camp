				p Established in 1998, and now under completely new management and leadership our camp seeks to teach and inspire climbers of all abilities to achieve great new heights. We will offer world class instruction through on ice clinics in one of the most exciting ice climbing venues in the world. Our nightly speakers will draw from some of the most accomplished and inspiring alpinists and ice climbers alive. Regardless if you are an experienced climber or completely new to the sport the Camp can raise you to the next level as well as connect you to the ever growing community of climbers. We will be a champion for safety, stewardship, education and tons of on and off ice fun.
				p Camp's members work as Mountain Guides all over the world, in the world’s famous climbing areas and high mountain ranges. Every guide has a solid base of experience, knowledge and skill. Collectively they share a common passion for climbing, mountaineering and skiing, and a professionalism for leading groups in challenging and hazardous terrain. Beyond this, they are a diverse group of individuals, with a wide range of achievements and other interests.
