                    p What started thousands of years ago as a mode of transportation has evolved into a popular winter activity for recreation and fitness. Here's why:
                    p Snowshoeing extends your hiking or running season into winter. It lets you enjoy winter solitude and can be a social activity. All ages and ability levels can enjoy the sport together.
                    p As the saying goes, "If you can walk, you can snowshoe." The learning curve is much shorter than that of skiing or snowboarding. A few techniques worth practicing: widening your stance (to avoid stepping on snowshoe frames), going up and down hills, traversing slopes and pole usage.
                    p Required gear includes snowshoes, appropriate footwear and clothing, and (maybe) a pair of poles. That's it! No lift ticket is required.
                    p Snowshoeing offers low-impact, aerobic exercise that helps you stay in shape during the winter.
                    p You can go easy or go hard. Plus, you can snowshoe many trails that you can't ski due to trees or low-snow conditions.

                                    p Walking on flat or rolling ground is fairly intuitive when you first start out. Most snowshoes have simple "strap and go" bindings that fit a wide range of boot styles and sizes. Your stance should be wider than normal when you're on snowshoes (in order to keep from stepping on the insides of the frames), so you may feel your hips and groin muscles ache after the first few times out.

                                    p Backcountry snowshoers will often be sharing the trail with cross-country skiers. Try to make your own trail whenever possible, staying out of the tracks skiers have worked so hard to set. Skiers have the right-of-way on trail systems, since it's easier for a snowshoer to step off the trail safely than it is for a skier to stop or go around. Always be polite to the folks you meet along the trail.

                                    p As you ascend hills, you use your toe or instep crampons for traction. Always place your feet firmly on snow, poles in front of you. Several techniques can come into play, depending on the conditions.
                                        ul
                                            li In powdery snow, use the kick-step technique. Pick up your foot and literally kick into the snow with the toe of your boot to create a step. Your snowshoes will be on the angle of the slope, with the tails hanging downhill behind you and the toes above your boots. This plants the crampons or cleats into the snow, directly under the balls of your feet. If conditions are such that a kick-step ends up just creating a deep hole in the snow, then look for a different route.
                                            li On crusty, hardpack snow, you probably won't be able to kick step. Instead, you'll be relying on your traction devices (claws) and poles. Walk up the slope, but if it's too steep try to find an easier traversing route.
                                            li On moderate to steep slopes, flip up the heel lift feature (also known as a climbing bar or Televator) found under the heel on many snowshoes. This puts your leg in a more comfortable position for long ascents.

                                    p On descents, keep your poles planted in front of you, knees bent and relaxed, and your body weight slightly back. Walk smoothly and plant heel first, then toe. A few considerations:
                                        ul
                                            li Your instinct will be to lean back on the snowshoe tails. This reaction works well on models with angled crampons built into the heel, which are designed to dig in as you descend.
                                            li When wearing snowshoes without heel crampons, you'll need to keep your weight over your feet, so your toe crampons will be planted firmly. Poles can provide a great deal more balance and control as you descend.
                                            li Avoid overswinging your leg as this can cause your tails to flip out in front of you. If the slope steepens, be sure to keep your weight back. If you slip, just sit down.

                                    p Traversing or "side-hilling" is a common method of travel and can be used to avoid overly steep or difficult terrain. Keeping your balance is key.
                                        ul
                                            li Push the uphill side of each snowshoe into the slope to create a shelf as you move along. Keep your weight on the uphill snowshoe.
                                            li If possible, walk in the steps made by the person in front of you.
                                            li Use your poles. Extend the downhill pole and shorten the uphill pole until they're even.

                                    p While optional on flat terrain, poles come in handy on many snowshoeing outings. They not only provide you better balance, they also help give your upper body a workout.
                                        ul
                                            li Adjustable poles are best. They can be shortened for uphill travel, lengthened for descending. And when crossing slopes, one can be extended for the downhill side and the other shortened for the uphill side.
                                            li Pole length should be adjusted so your arm is bent at a right angle. Flip your pole upside-down and grab the pole just under the basket. Adjust the length until your elbow is at a right angle.
                                            li Pole straps li are used properly when you put your hand up through the strap from below. This allows you to rely on the straps alone at times to give your hands a brief rest.
